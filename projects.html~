<p class="project_text">This was my first big project and where I pushed myself the most. 
Created a scalable drug categorization program. First analyzed cell data and determined clusters, next parallelized the program for performance and lastly visualized the data. I was pleasantly surprised with the bronze award at the end.
All in all, a very rewarding experience. </p>

<h3 style="color:orange;">FRI: Computational Intelligence in Game Design</h3>
<p class="project_text">During my second semester at the UT I decided to try out some research. I was learning to cook at the time and wanted to tie that in with my project. I decided to make a spaghetti sauce generator using AI techniques.
For the final presentation, I actually made the spaghetti dish that my program produced, needless to say, it was a hit among everyone ;)</p>

<h3 style="color:orange;">twitteR: Twitter API for R</h3>
<p class="project_text">I had just finished my summer internship and did extensive work
with R and the Twitter API. I also had always wanted to do an Open Source project.
After a lot of reading up of the Twitter API documentation and OAuth 2.0 specs,
I implemented a new form of authentication that the R package did not support.
It was called Application-Only Authentication and it increased rate limit from 180 to 450 requests/hour</p>
