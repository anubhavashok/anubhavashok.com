<p class="project_text">I had just finished my summer internship and did extensive work
with R and the Twitter API. I also had always wanted to do an Open Source project.
After a lot of reading up of the Twitter API documentation and OAuth 2.0 specs,
I implemented a new form of authentication that the R package did not support.
It was called Application-Only Authentication and it increased rate limit from 180 to 450 requests/hour</p>
