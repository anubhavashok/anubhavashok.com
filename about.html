<h3 class= "about_titles">About Me</h3>
Hello. My name is Anubhav Ashok. Most of my friends call me Bhav. <br>
I am currently a Junior CS Major in The University of Texas at Austin. <br>
I can often be spotted at the labs of <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/gdc.html">GDC</a> or around campus doing fun stuff.<br>
<br>
I am passionate about building stuff and solving complex problems (check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> to see what I have been up to). <br>
I got my first computer when I was 13 and have never looked back since.<br>
<br>
<h3 class= "about_titles">My Story</h3>
<p>
I was born in Singapore, where I lived my first 18 years. <br>
I arrived in Austin in summer 2011 and have since become a die-hard Austinite. <br>
I hope to one day reach the sunny land of California.<br>
<br>
I believe in good food, doing good and having a great time.<br>
My diet consists of a lot of Tacos and a lot of <a href="http://www.teasoftexas.com/">Texas Tea</a>.<br>
I strongly believe everyone should learn to code.<br>
I try to surround myself with smart passionate people as much as I can.<br>
I truly beleive that a person creates him/her self through what they do. <br>
