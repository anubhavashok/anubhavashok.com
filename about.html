<p>Hello. My name is Anubhav Ashok. Most of my friends call me bhav. <br>
I am currently a Junior CS Major in The University of Texas at Austin. <br>

<p>
I was born in Singapore, where I lived my first 18 years.<br>
Went to school for a few years and got by with above average grades. <br>
Decided to go to university in the states because my elder brothers did it and it was the cool thing to do at that time. <br>
Found myself at Austin and started my journey through life. <br>
