<p class="title">HPC Quest</p>
<p>The HPCQuest was my first big programming project. At the time I had 2 months of programming experience and did not know what to expect. It was an extremely difficult but rewarding journey. It was supposed to be a group project but the other members in my team were not as motivated or as adventurous as me, so I ended up doing all of the work myself. I did however delegate some extra work to them though so that they stuck with it.</p>
<class ="subtitle">About</p>
<p>This project was a competition organized by the A* Star research institute in Singapore to engage Junior College students and introduce them to research. The A*star institute was a government founded research institute that was the largest one in Asia. The project itself was split into 3 parts: Implementation, Parallelization and Visualization (bonus). We were given a dataset containing 10 cell parameters and had to normalize and group them according to the clusters they formed. </p>

<class ="subtitle">Implementation</p>
<p>The first step was to form a Euclidean Distance Matrix of the cells by calculating the relative distance between each cell. ##insert image. The closest cells were then grouped into clusters and printed out. This was the most straightforward part, however it had the steepest learning curve as I was new to programming and only knew C++. There were some simple optimizations done at this stage such as using a boolean array to indicate if the columns have been clustered yet or not.</p>
