<p>Hello. My name is Anubhav Ashok. Most of my friends call me bhav. <br>
I am currently a Junior CS Major in The University of Texas at Austin. <br>
I can often be spotted at the labs of <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/gdc.html">GDC</a> working on school stuff or my own projects. <br><br>
I am extremely passionate about building stuff and making ideas a reality. <br>
I started making game mods for FIFA 2005 in my free time when I was 13 and have never looked back since.

<p>
I was born in Singapore, where I lived my first 18 years.<br>
Went to school for a few years and got by with above average grades. <br>
Decided to go to university in the states because my elder brothers did it and it was the cool thing to do at that time. <br>
Found myself at Austin and started my journey through life. <br>
</p>
<h3 style ="text-align:center;">Interesting Facts</h3>
<p>
Some people say I am too intense; I thank them for the compliment.<br>
I believe in dressing well, having a good time and The Dream.<br>
My diet consists of a lot of Tacos and a lot of Texas Tea.<br>
I think learning how to code is an essential skill to have.<br>
I try to surround myself with smart passionate people as much as I can.<br>
I truly believe that a person creates him/her self through what they do. <br>
