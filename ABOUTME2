Hello. My name is Anubhav Ashok. Most of my friends call me Bhav. I am currently a Junior CS Major in The University of Texas at Austin. I can often be spotted at the labs of GDC or around campus doing fun stuff.

I am passionate about building stuff and solving complex problems (check out my projects to see what I have been up to). I got my first computer when I was 13 and have never looked back since.

My story

I was born in Singapore, where I lived my first 18 years. I arrived in Austin in summer 2011 and have since become a die-hard Austinite. I hope to one day reach the sunny land of California.

I believe in good food, doing good and having a great time.
My diet consists of a lot of Tacos and a lot of Texas Tea.
I strongly believe everyone should learn to code.
I try to surround myself with smart passionate people as much as I can.
I truly beleive that a person creates him/her self through what they do. 

If you want to chat, do send me an email and I promise to respond.
