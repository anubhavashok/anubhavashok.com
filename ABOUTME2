Hello. My name is Anubhav Ashok. Most of my friends call me bhav. I am currently a Junior CS Major in The University of Texas at Austin. I can often be spotted at the labs of GDC working on school stuff or my own projects. 

I am extremely passionate about building stuff and making ideas a reality. I started making game mods for FIFA 2005 in my free time when I was 13 and have never looked back since.

My story

I was born in Singapore, where I lived my first 18 years.
Went to school for a few years and got by with above average grades. Decided to go to university in the states because my elder brothers did it and it was the cool thing to do at that time. Found myself at Austin and started my journey through life.

Some people say I am too intense; I thank them for the compliment.
I believe in The Dream, dressing well and having a good time.
My diet consists of a lot of Tacos and a lot of Texas Tea.
I think learning how to code is an essential skill to have.
I try to surround myself with smart passionate people as much as I can.
I truly beleive that a person creates him/her self through what they do.
